This repository demonstrates a common Firebase error where you attempt to access data from a listener before it has populated. The bug.js file shows the problematic code, while bugSolution.js provides the corrected version using appropriate asynchronous techniques to ensure data availability.  The error often manifests as a null pointer exception, undefined variable, or unexpected behavior. The solution highlights using promises or async/await to handle data loading asynchronously.
